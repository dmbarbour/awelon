-- | AOI describes a simplistic, imperative REPL for language AO.
-- AOI will start by importing the "aoi" dictionary unless a .ao 
-- file is specified on the command line, in which case the specified
-- dictionary is loaded.
--
--   TODO: leverage haskeline, possibly ansi-terminal
-- 
-- AOI has a trivial effects model, documented in the standard aoi 
-- dictionary file. AOI also enables reprogramming the interpreter
-- from within. If a word 'prelude.aoi' is found, it will run before
-- handing the interpreter to the user.
--
-- AOI does keep track of historical states, using an exponential
-- decay algorithm. In addition, it keeps track of frames in the
-- current state. Between these attributes, AOI should be decent 
-- for debugging (providing both a stack trace and a history). 
--
-- Interactive AO is intended to be reactive like spreadsheets, with
-- more pure functions or RDP behaviors in test environments. AOI is
-- only intended to help gain confidence with libraries and support
-- bootstrap. That is, AOI is considered a useful scaffolding but 
-- is not intended to become a final product.
