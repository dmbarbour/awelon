"A 'map' in computer science typically refers to an abstract, finite collection of (key, value) pairs where each key appears at most once in the collection. Other terms used for similar ideas include 'dictionary' and 'associative array'. Typical operations on maps include:
 
     add, remove, or update (key, value) pairs
     lookup value given the key, or test if key exists
     compose two maps in various ways (join, union, etc.)
     stream or list processing of (key*value) pairs
 
 Shorthand type: (K,V)`Map
 
 A map is typically implemented using hashtables or balanced search trees or hashtables. In this case, that is for AO words of the `.m` suffix, we'll be favoring the simple 2-3 tree, which has predictable performance even in a persistent setting. The map as a whole will additionally track a key comparison function and encapsulate everything behind a discretionary `{:m}` sealer (to prevent accidental manipulations).
 
 The keys must have a homogeneous type, suitable for ordinal comparison `(K*K)â†’Ord` (cf `doc.Ordinal`). The values may have heterogeneous type dependent on key, e.g. to model ad-hoc records. 
 
 Many related types can be trivially modeled above maps, including multi-maps (via collection type for values), sets (unit values), and multi-sets (counter values). But maps are not always ideal, e.g. if developers have a large collection of maps all using the same keys then some sort of table-based data structure would be more appropriate. If keys share a lot of structure, then a trie may be more appropriate. If keys represent spatial coordinates, a kd-tree may be more appropriate. I would love to have a wide array of moderately specialized data structures for common use-cases.
