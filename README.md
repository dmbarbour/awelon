# Awelon

Awelon is a richly typed, compiled, tacit programming language for reactive demand programming (RDP). RDP is a general purpose, reactive dataflow model that addresses challenges involving open, distributed, and heterogeneous systems. In Awelon, a single application can include code that executes across a distributed network. 

This Haskell project will provide a compiler for Awelon.
