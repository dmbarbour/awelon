Shared state is modeled as an external resource in RDP and ABC. 

Goals includue:
* Ability to define the state model.
* Ability to upgrade the state model.
* Ability to model one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many state

Hypothesis: to upgrade state model, it must be controlled by an agent. All state resources should start as exclusive state resources, using a stable uniqueness source. Open state (DHTs, etc.) can be modeled as participating/contributing to a collaborative state model.

Hypothesis: source stable uniqueness is important even for the history of the user input stream. Relevantly, we must be able to edit the past. However, perhaps source stable uniqueness could be the default but effectively optional as an abstraction inversion to modeling automatic/incremental identities for some purposes. An advantage is that this provides URL-like uniqueness.



Also, state models in Awelon Project will NOT be accessible in the first stage. 


Uniqueness, however, might be available.
