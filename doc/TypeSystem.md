Common Types
============

* **asynchronous product** (x & y) both are available at the same times.
    * x ~> x & x
    * x & y ~> x
* **choice of provider** (x | y) at most one is available at a time.
    * Either x y ~> x | y



AVM Dependent Types
===================

The types available for a particular application will depend on the Awelon Virtual Machine and partition. 


Notes
=====

The type system is the real heart of Awelon language. We don't have a fixed set of primitives, nor a fixed syntax, but we do need a common type model so we can validate distributd app code against a target machine description.

Requirements
============

It is necessary to target and interact with existing devices. Therefore, such type models as simple integers, 

An RDP model distributes and manipulates values. For simplicity
