Apparently the F* developers at Microsoft have managed to implement a "full abstraction" from F* to JS, with respect to security properties of their code. This seems like an outstanding idea. I should do it, too. When the time comes, review the appropriate pubs at the [F* project page](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fstar/).
