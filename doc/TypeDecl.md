Currently, ABC has no effective way to declare types.

It used to be, you could use observer operators (`P`, `S`, `B`, `N`) together with assertions to say a little something about types. However, I've removed these observers.

An interesting possibility I'm considering is to introduce or utilize a concept of a virtual fork:

        X :: a*e â†’ ((a+a)*e)  

Where, in this case, the result is certainly in the right-hand side, but (unlike `V`) we have some assumed type relationship to the left-hand side. The result could be merged with `K` or `M` (but not `C`).

Essentially, this allows us to say that some function *should* be applicable to a value, without actually applying it.

**Question:** Can this be implemented without new operators?

**Answer:** Now that I think about it, probably yes. Some sort of distribution across void should work:
      
        true.b swap distrib trimBoolean

        [x -- (x+x)] (in right)

Maybe I should create a pair of functions for distrib inR and distrib inL.
