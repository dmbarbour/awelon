For manipulation of text and other structures, I'd like to develop good libraries for:

* regular expressions (cf. partial derivatives for regexps, [1](http://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2013/11/antimirov-derivatives-for-regular.html)
* grammar combinators (cf. OMeta)
* efficient sequences (ropes, finger-trees)
* folds, streaming

I'd also like good support for lazily generated structure, and for zipping or procedural generation of higher dimensional structures. 

(I wonder if I can model large 3D structures as functions that can be manipulated then, once restored to functional form, systematically optimized and compressed.)
